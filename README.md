[Read a brief description of the project including screenshots here](https://github.com/athkarandikar/vehicle-insurance-management-system/blob/main/Vehicle%20Insurance%20Management%20System.pdf)

The project is a 1064-line good quality code vehicle insurance management system that can be used by insurance agents to manage their customers and their policies. The system has many options to begin with.

Files created will be stored in directory “./Database” which in turn contains 2 directories – “./Database/Customers” & “./Database/Policies”.

The directory “./Database/Customers” contains a file “.all_customers.txt” which will contain all the customer IDs, and files storing customer details will have name “customer_<customerId>.txt”, and directory “./Database/Policies” contains a file “all_policies.txt” which will contain all the policy numbers, and file storing policy details will have name “policy_<policyNo>.txt”.
